# Introduction to C\#

Welcome to the introduction to C# tutorials. These lessons start with interactive code that you can run in your browser. You can learn the basics of C# from the [C# for Beginners video series](https://aka.ms/dotnet/beginnervideos/youtube/csharp) before starting these interactive lessons.

The first lessons explain C# concepts using small snippets of code. You'll learn the basics of C# syntax and how to work with data types like strings, numbers, and booleans. It's all interactive, and you'll be writing and running code within minutes. These first lessons assume no prior knowledge of programming or the C# language. Each lesson builds on the prior lessons. You should do them in order. However, if you have some programming experience, you can skip or skim the first lessons and start with any new concepts.

You can try these tutorials in different environments. The concepts you'll learn are the same. The difference is which experience you prefer:

## Hello world

In the [Hello world](https://learn.microsoft.comdotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/hello-world) tutorial, you'll create the most basic C# program. You'll explore the `string` type and how to work with text.

## Numbers in C\#

In the [Numbers in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/numbers-in-csharp) tutorial, you'll learn how computers store numbers and how to perform calculations with different numeric types. You'll learn the basics of rounding, and how to perform mathematical calculations using C#.

## Tuples and types

In the [Tuples and types](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/tuples-and-types) tutorial, you'll learn to create types in C#. You can create *tuples*, *records*, *struct*, and *class* types. The capabilities of these different kinds of types reflect their different uses.

## Branches and loops

The [Branches and loops](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/branches-and-loops) tutorial teaches the basics of selecting different paths of code execution based on the values stored in variables. You'll learn the basics of control flow, which is the basis of how programs make decisions and choose different actions.

## List collection

The [List collection](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/list-collection) lesson gives you a tour of the List collection type that stores sequences of data. You'll learn how to add and remove items, search for items, and sort the lists. You'll explore different kinds of lists.

## Pattern matching

The [Pattern matching](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/pattern-matching) lesson provides an introduction to *pattern matching*. Pattern matching enables you to compare an expression against a pattern. The success of the match determines which program logic to follow. Patterns can compare types, properties of a type, or contents of a list. You can combine multiple patterns using `and`, `or`, and `not` logic. Patterns provide a rich vocabulary to inspect data and make decisions in your program based on that inspection.
